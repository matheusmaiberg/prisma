## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: Why delete instead of refactor?

**A**: Code has ZERO usage. No backend implementation exists. Payload CMS already handles auth. It's genuinely dead code.

### Q: What if we need session management later?

**A**: Implement it when needed (YAGNI principle). Payload has session management. If custom needed, build from scratch with actual requirements.

### Q: Is this safe?

**A**: YES. Code is disconnected. Only 5 payment components import auth-context (already deleted). Script includes verification and rollback.

### Q: What about payment components breaking?

**A**: They temporarily lose auth (expected). Need Payload integration before production use. Documented in Breaking Changes.

### Q: Can I do this partially?

**A**: NOT RECOMMENDED. Files are interdependent. Partial deletion leaves broken imports. Do all or nothing.

### Q: How long to rollback if needed?

**A**: < 1 minute via `git reset --hard HEAD~1`

### Q: Who should approve this?

**A**: Tech Lead (technical decision) + Product Owner (roadmap impact)
